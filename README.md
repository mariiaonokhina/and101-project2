# AND101 Project 2 - Kotlin Debug-a-thon

Submitted by: **Mariia Onokhina**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Debug-a-thon** is an android app that was riddled with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs.  With those gone, it's a collection of widgets for a variety of purposes!

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: 😵‍💫💡😼

## Notes

- At first, it was challenging to figure out the bugs, so I was stuck for a long time and eventually had to use hints.
- Later, I started looking at each line, thinking critically if it is causing any issues.
- The easiest challenge to complete was about random colors, I solved it almost right away.
